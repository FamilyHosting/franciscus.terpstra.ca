<p>Franciscus Terpstra was born of Friesian descent into a musically gifted family in 1949.  His mother was a trained operatic singer and his Uncle a violinist in the Amsterdam Symphony Orchestra.  Brother Siemen, a renowned musicologist lectures regularly in Universities across Europe and North America.  Brother Anthony is the leader of one of the last big bands, The Starlight Orchestra, performing regularly in Toronto's large ballrooms.  Franciscus has performed professionally in various venues aross Canada for the past 30 years.  The family Steinway piano is presently on display in the foyer of Hamilton Place, Ontario.</p>

<p>Formally trained at the University of Victoria, BC music department, Franciscus studied composition and theory, music history and piano.  While pursuing his endeavours at university, he supported his young family as a popular band leader playing keyboards, lead vocals and lead guitar.  During the early 1990's he pursued his dream of performing classical guitar concert pieces in the beautiful setting of the Inner Harbour of Victoria, BC as a busker.  This setting inspired his first album entitled <em>The Inner Harbour</em>, recorded on board his home, the 65' sailing vessel Wayfinder.</p>

<p>With Wayfinder moored in Vancouver's False Creek, he produced a second album, <em>Memories of Granville Island.</em> In May of 2000, he produced his first compact disc recording, <em>Spanish Guitar</em>, which was quickly followed by <em>Classic Guitar</em> and <em>For Christmas</em> in 2001 and 2002 respectively.  His latest album, <em>Solo Guitar Favorites</em>, was released earlier this year.</p>

<p>Franciscus has a unique technique.  Utilizing the rich tonal and dynamic range offered by an electrified instrument, he displays an expressive textural control that produces music charged with feelings and emotions.  An elite repertoire of concert pieces include: Bach's Chaconne, Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, Ravel's Pavane pour une Infante DÃ©funte, Debussy's Reverie and other classical masterpieces, with a considerable portion of his programme devoted to Spanish masterpieces such as Asturias, Recuerdos de la Alhambra and other equally appealing delights.</p>
